Harnessing the power of chemical energy!

Chemical Energistics (CE) is a mod aimed at the production and usage of chemical energy to do all sorts of things, such as generating energy, fabricating items, or even creating weapons of mass destruction!

### Contributing

Wish to contribute to the project? Well, you can do so in multiple ways, whether it be through code, artwork, music, or even translating into different languages and testing, I appreciate it all!

### Submitting Issues
---
While the mod may not be released, testers are expected to report issues here. Here, I need very specific details about the issue, so I can get it fixed. All issues also need to be replicated, meaning you can cause the issue to happen "at will". If not, then I won't look at it.

I need a description of the issue, if possible, screenshots or videos of the issue, and anything else you might find necessary. If you are crashing, POST THE ERROR LOG VIA GIST OR PASTEBIN.

Do not submit issues for items/blocks under the TEST creative tab, or under features I list as broken, or missing textures. It just makes things more complicated than it needs to be.
